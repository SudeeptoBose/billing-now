# Billing-Now
### A simple billing system for any small retail shop
This project has many incomplete requirements and the end product is objectively flawed. I followed the instructions to the best of my abilities, but had to make compromises in some areas in order to mimic the intended output. The purpose of this project was to test my ability to fullfil different needs and requirements. 
## Contributing 
Pull requests are welcome. You can check out the project and make your own alterations. But I would suggest going on Youtube and watch [Vijay Thapa's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lttd3ohTarE&list=PLBLPjjQlnVXVnz3Hksi1th0uHXxh6Dm3h) playlist on making a proper billing system in C#.
